Application needs
	To capture Licensing Instructor Number for the state database
	Instructor Assignments
		Instructors should be assigned to classes when that is known
		The instructor number should be stored in the instructors table
		A new field would be added to the class_schedule table to hold the instructor assigned to the class
		
	If more than one instructor is assigned to a class
		A new table (bridge table) would be created to accommodate the requirements
			This table would hold the class id and instructor number for each class
			The result would be the ability to have a 1 to many relationship between instructors and class_schedule
			
			Assumptions
			The same instructor(s) cannot be assigned to more than one class on the same weekend
