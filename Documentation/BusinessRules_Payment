Payment History
Purpose: Some parts of the payment history will be removed after the class date has passed or when the payment has been processed
When a payment has been processed
	These items will be removed
		Credit card name (name on the card)
		Credit card number
		Credit card expiration
		Credit card verification value (CVV)
	These items will be left in the table
		Payment id associated with the registration
		Payment type associated with the registration
		Promotion code if any exists
	These items will be updated
		Processed will be set to true (by default it is false)
User Actions:
	To flag a payment as processed
		Go to the administration portal
		Click on the registrations link
		Click the number of registrations in the class list to get the class roster
		Under the payment heading
			If there is a $ (dollar sign) then the payment has been processed
			If there is an "alert" icon, click it to process the payment
			
Process Notes:
	It is important to complete this step for security. You want to clear any data that can be compromised and you can potentially be liable for.
	
	Credit card data should not be necessary once payment has been processed and/or received.
