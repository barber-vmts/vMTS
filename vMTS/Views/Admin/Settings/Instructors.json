                "Sometimes it is interesting to hear how people got started riding. It certainly is for Melanie and I. There was no way my parents were going to give me, or even allow me, a motorcycle or scooter as a kid growing up. I had cousins with a mini-bike, but that was about it. So, we didn't learn how much fun it was until our kids were grown adults and we made a business trip to Bermuda. There you can't rent a car, so the only transportation options are taxis or rent a scooter. We had so much fun that week that when I returned home, I decided to research the purchase of a motorcycle.",
                "Well, for those of you who know Melanie, she was not about to be left behind and did not like riding behind me. I was not a very good rider (but certainly would not admit it at the time), and I insisted that Melanie enroll in rider training. As a show of support, I enrolled with her. I can not begin tell you how much I did not know.",
                "A few years later, I found myself unemployed due to downsizing, so I became an instructor and immediately started Volunteer Motorcycle Training Service with Melanie.",
                "Currently, I ride a 2003 Harley-Davidson Electragide Classic and a 2016 Harley-Davidson Triglide.",
                "As I get older, I am becoming more appreciative of the old motorcycles that helped get many of us started, like the Honda Dream and Scrambler, the old Harley panheads and shovel heads, the Kawasaki 2-cycle three cylinder known as the widowmaker, the Harley Hummer and so many more.",
                "We love to teach and share our passion for motorcycling. If I can be of assistance, send me an email."

                "I started with a Yamaha 650 for one season, then changed to a Harley-Davidson Sportster. Currently, I have a 2016 Harley-Davidson Triglide. We have made several trips on our motorcycles, two of which were to Milwaukee for the 95th and 100th Harley-Davidson celebrations. Riding is such a thrill that is hard to explain. It is just like the saying goes \"if I have to explain, you would not understand\".",

I thought I was a good rider before taking the RiderCoach certificate course; not a great rider but a good rider. Little did I know how much I didn’t know. Being a RiderCoach has sharpened my skills more than I could ever imagine. I enjoy teaching the the Basic RiderCourse.",

I continued riding dirt bikes until I was old enough to get out the road. I rode until my mid-twenties and started having kids. We were young and diapers were expensive, so the toys had to go for a while. I would occasionally borrow a bike and go for a ride. Once my kids got older, I decided to return to riding on more occasions.",

I continue to find opportunities to get further training in the sport. I feel the more advanced techniques and skills that I have, the more likely I will continue to be safe and arrive home alive. ",
