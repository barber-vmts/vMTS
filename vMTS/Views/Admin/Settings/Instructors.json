                "Sometimes it is interesting to hear how people got started riding. It certainly is for Melanie and I. There was no way my parents were going to give me, or even allow me, a motorcycle or scooter as a kid growing up. I had cousins with a mini-bike, but that was about it. So, we didn't learn how much fun it was until our kids were grown adults and we made a business trip to Bermuda. There you can't rent a car, so the only transportation options are taxis or rent a scooter. We had so much fun that week that when I returned home, I decided to research the purchase of a motorcycle.",
                "Well, for those of you who know Melanie, she was not about to be left behind and did not like riding behind me. I was not a very good rider (but certainly would not admit it at the time), and I insisted that Melanie enrol in rider training. As a show of support, I enrolled with her. I can not begin tell you how much I did not know.",
                "A few years later, I found myself unemployed due to downsizing, so I became an instructor and immediately started Volunteer Motorcycle Training Service with Melanie.",
                "Currently, I ride a 2003 Harley-Davidson Electragide Classic. I can not say that I won't buy another motorcycle, but I can safely say I have no plans to sell my 100th anniversary motorcycle. These will become rare collectables some day. Maybe the grandchildren will enjoy it one day.",

                "I have been riding for about 10 years. I started with a Yamaha 650 for one season, then changed to a Harley-Davidson Sportster. Currently, I have a 2003 anniversary edition Harley-Davidson Heritage Classic. We have made several trips on our motorcycles, two of which were to Milwaukee for the 95th and 100th Harley-Davidson celebrations. Riding is such a thrill that is hard to explain. It is just like the saying goes \"if I have to explain, you would not understand\".",

                "I decided to become a Rider Coach primarily to help Steve when he first started the training course. I thought I was a good rider before taking the Rider Coach Prep Course; not a great rider but a good rider. Little did I know how much I didn’t know. Being a Rider Coach has sharpened my skills more than I could ever imagine. Even now, I attend the Experienced RiderCourse as a student to help keep my skills sharp. I really enjoy teaching the class room sections of the Basic RiderCourse.",

While there I worked in Patrol, Community Relations and Auto Theft Divisions and was assigned to Motorcycles in July 1974. I was still assigned to Motorcycles when I retired.",
                "It was a fantastic life that I miss far more than I thought. It is the only job you get paid for doing the same thing you were doing when you were 18 years old, ridding around trying to get in trouble.They will even pay you to do it on a motorcycle.",

                "I attended a motorcycle safety class knowing that I was a good rider. But I finished the class one point from failing. This was a wake up call; I didn’t know as much as I thought. At this point, I started thinking how fortunate I was to be alive! Learning to teach safety courses became a personal mission for me. In October 1999, I successfully completed the course to become an Instructor.",
                "In 2003, I was sponsored by the Tennessee Motorcycle Rider Education Program to attend the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Chief School in Colton, California. After successful completion, I became the first Afro American Chief Instructor.",

                "I started riding a friend’s mini-bike when I was in junior high school. When we were in high school, he got a Honda 550-4. My friend let me borrow his Honda to \"cruise\" the downtown area of our Indiana home town. No rider training, just hopped on and rode; very risky looking back.",
                "Fast forward when I worked for Eastern Airlines in Miami, Florida. I got the bug to ride, and again, no formal training was available. I did buy a copy of the \"Hurt Report\" and educated myself on the riding do’s and don'ts. I purchased a new Suzuki GS850GT (shaft drive) and trained myself on the highways of south Florida, driving amongst the mix of drivers from New York City, Cuba and other places of South America.",
                "We moved to Minnesota, where riding is limited to 6 mo, or less, as compared to 12 mo in south Florida. I found the Motorcycle Safety Foundation and enrolled in a rider training program, and became an \"Instructor\" in 1990. Then, the kids came along and riding was put on the back burner. I sold my Suzuki and didn’t ride again until we relocated to Tennessee in 2006.",
                "I currently ride a 2005 BMW KT1200LT. I have been married for 25 years and my wife also rides a Suzuki 650 Burgman scooter. We enjoy riding the mountains of east Tennessee, western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Parkway.",
                "I renewed my skills as an Instructor in 2008. I enjoy facilitating the Basic RiderCourse and enjoy new riders who go from little to no knowledge to being certified to ride on the streets.",

                "My husband, Mark, and I were at the Nashville Superspeedway one day for an autocross with the Nashville Corvette Club, and noticed a handful of motorcycles and riders doing something in the parking. Wow! There are classes for learning how to ride! It was intriguing, but still took me over a year later to decide that was for me.",
                "We obtained our motorcycle endorsements, but didn’t have any bikes to ride. A friend loaned us a pair of Kawasaki Ninja 250s to ride. Mark started looking for motorcycles of our own. We now own a 1979 Honda Goldwing, 1979 Honda CB750 and Kawasaki Vulcan 500.",
                "I have come a long way from being shy and nervous about motorcycling where I got my husband to ask someone at Nashville Superspeedway what was happening to becoming a RiderCoach. I feel I can make a difference in the way people learn to ride.",
