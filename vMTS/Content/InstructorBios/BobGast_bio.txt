I started riding a friend’s mini-bike when I was in junior high school. When we were in high school, he got a Honda 550-4. My friend let me borrow his Honda to "cruise" the downtown area of our Indiana home town. No rider training, just hopped on and rode; very risky looking back.

Fast forward when I worked for Eastern Airlines in Miami, Florida. I got the bug to ride, and again, no formal training was available. I did buy a copy of the "Hurt Report" and educated myself on the riding do’s and don'ts. I purchased a new Suzuki GS850GT (shaft drive) and trained myself on the highways of south Florida, driving amongst the mix of drivers from New York City, Cuba and other places of South America.

We moved to Minnesota, where riding is limited to 6 mo, or less, as compared to 12 mo in south Florida. I found the Motorcycle Safety Foundation and enrolled in a rider training program, and became an "Instructor" in 1990. Then, the kids came along and riding was put on the back burner. I sold my Suzuki and didn’t ride again until we relocated to Tennessee in 2006.

I currently ride a 2005 BMW KT1200LT. I have been married for 25 years and my wife also rides a Suzuki 650 Burgman scooter. We enjoy riding the mountains of east Tennessee, western North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Parkway.

I renewed my skills as an Instructor in 2008. I enjoy facilitating the Basic RiderCourse and enjoy new riders who go from little to no knowledge to being certified to ride on the streets.

I hope to see you at Nashville Super Speedway, where you can learn to ride a motorcycle in a single weekend. If I can be of help, send me an email.
