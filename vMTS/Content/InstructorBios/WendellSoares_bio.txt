Hello all, my name is Wendell Soares and I have been a Rider Coach in the State of Tennessee’s Motorcycle Rider Education Program (MREP) since 2000.  Like so many of my riding colleagues my motorcycling adventure started one summer may years ago with a group of us kids chipping in our money to purchase a red Cushman powered mini-bike and the rest is history.

Like you are about to experience, I too was introduced to the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF) Basic Rider Course (BRC) back in the spring of 1983 or 1985 (can’t remember exactly) at Tacoma, WA and I have not looked back since.

I enjoy all types of motorcycling and have owned many different types of motorcycles throughout the years.  Presently I own a touring, sport touring, and my little Triumph Scrambler affectionately known as “the scram”.  I am passionate about riding and helping others achieve their riding goals, which is the driving force for my enthusiastic participation within the State of Tennessee’s MREP.

I look forwards to seeing you in one of our many courses in the upcoming riding season and remember to waive when you see me on the open roads that leads to some of the most beautiful locals within our great country.
