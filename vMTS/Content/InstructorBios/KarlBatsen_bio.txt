I started riding motorcycles in 1974 after my parents bought me a Yamaha 90cc twin. For years this was my main transportation.  Twenty-two motorcycles and thirty-seven years later, I enjoy riding as much as I did when I first started.

I attended a motorcycle safety class knowing that I was a good rider. But I finished the class <strong>one point</strong> from failing. This was a wake up call; I didnâ€™t know as much as I thought.  At this point, I started thinking how fortunate I was to be alive!   Learning to teach safety courses became a personal mission for me.  In October 1999, I  successfully completed the course to become an Instructor.

In 2003, I was sponsored by the Tennessee Motorcycle Rider Education Program to attend the Motorcycle Safety Foundation Chief School in Colton, California. After successful completion, I became the first Afro American Chief Instructor.

I currently own a 2013 Goldwing F6B  and  ride a 1998 Harley Dyna Lowrider.  As of December 2015, I have logged over 544,000 miles on seven Goldwings, covering 42 of the 48 continental  united states, Canada and Mexico.</p>

I serve as a consultant to the State of Tennessee's  Motorcycle Rider Education Program and serve as a part time Ridercoach.  I am a manager at the O'Charley's restaurant in Dickson, Tennessee and teach roller skating at Rivergate Skate Center in Madison.</p>

I offer weekday safety courses beginning in the spring  of 2016 for those of you who have difficulty taking off on the weekends.</p>
