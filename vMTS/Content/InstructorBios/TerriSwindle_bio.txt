For several years as a child I rode dirt bikes. As a teenager I moved to FL and that’s where I met and marred my husband, Terry. He and I have raised two wonderful children and have lived in Bethpage since 1988.

When the children left for college I suddenly found time to re-discover things I had enjoyed in the past and found time to try things I had always wanted to try, like yoga. Through all these years there were no motorcycles in my life until my husband bought my dad’s ’99 HD Wide Glide. He had always wanted a motorcycle. He took the BRC, received his M endorsement and started riding. He repeatedly asked me to ride with him but I refused. Then one day I did go and we ended up riding 175 miles. Spending that much time on a tiny Wide Glide seat convinced me that maybe my own motorcycle would be a better choice.

So, I signed up and took the next class available. I wondered if I might be afraid to ride again but our instructors were wonderful. One in particular really made an impression on me. Just talking with her on breaks reminded me how much fun riding is. So as they say, “The rest is history”. I love riding my ’01 HD Low Rider. We have a great time riding together and with friends. I am always looking for the next chance to ride.

Over the years I have guided Girl Scouts and coached several soccer teams. Being a rider coach is just a new way for me to share something else that I love and I hope everyone will join us in a class and on the road as a safe rider!
