<p>Sometimes it is interesting to hear how people got started riding. It certainly is for Melanie and I. There was no way my parents were going to give me, or even allow me, a motorcycle or scooter as a kid growing up. I had cousins with a mini-bike, but that was about it. So, we didn't learn how much fun it was until our kids were grown adults and we made a business trip to Bermuda. There you can't rent a car, so the only transportation options are taxis or rent a scooter. We had so much fun that week that when I returned home, I decided to research the purchase of a motorcycle.

Well, for those of you who know Melanie, she was not about to be left behind and did not like riding behind me. I was not a very good rider (but certainly would not admit it at the time), and I insisted that Melanie enrol in rider training. As a show of support, I enrolled with her. I can not begin tell you how much I did not know.

A few years later, I found myself unemployed due to downsizing, so I became an instructor and immediately started Volunteer Motorcycle Training Service with Melanie.

Currently, I ride a 2003 Harley-Davidson Electragide Classic. I can not say that I won't buy another motorcycle, but I can safely say I have no plans to sell my 100th anniversary motorcycle. These will become rare collectables some day. Maybe the grandchildren will enjoy it one day.
