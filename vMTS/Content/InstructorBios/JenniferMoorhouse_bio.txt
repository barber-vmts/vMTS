I remember my first ride as a child. A neighbor gave me a ride along our street. The driveway was gravel, and I remember skidding, falling, burned my leg and burned hole in a new pair of jeans. I didn't get back on a motorcycle again until I was around thirty years old.

My husband, Mark, and I were at the Nashville Superspeedway one day for an autocross with the Nashville Corvette Club, and noticed a handful of motorcycles and riders doing something in the parking. Wow! There are classes for learning how to ride! It was intriguing, but still took me over a year later to decide that was for me.

We obtained our motorcycle endorsements, but didnâ€™t have any bikes to ride. A friend loaned us a pair of Kawasaki Ninja 250s to ride. Mark started looking for motorcycles of our own. We now own a 1979 Honda Goldwing, 1979 Honda CB750 and Kawasaki Vulcan 500.

I have come a long way from being shy and nervous about motorcycling where I got my husband to ask someone at Nashville Superspeedway what was happening to becoming a RiderCoach. I feel I can make a difference in the way people learn to ride.

We enjoy our motorcycling and encourage motorcyclists to improve their riding skills through education. If I can be of assistance, send me an mail. Let's go riding!
