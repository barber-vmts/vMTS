<p>I have been riding for about 10 years. I started with a Yamaha 650 for one season, then changed to a Harley-Davidson Sportster. Currently, I have a 2003 anniversary edition Harley-Davidson Heritage Classic. We have made several trips on our motorcycles, two of which were to Milwaukee for the 95th and 100th Harley-Davidson celebrations. Riding is such a thrill that is hard to explain. It is just like the saying goes “if I have to explain, you would not understand”.

I am an Auditor by profession. I earned my Masters degree in December 2000. I am now working on my CPA certification.

I decided to become a Rider Coach primarily to help Steve when he first started the training course. I thought I was a good rider before taking the Rider Coach Prep Course; not a great rider but a good rider. Little did I know how much I didn’t know. Being a Rider Coach has sharpened my skills more than I could ever imagine. Even now, I attend the Experienced RiderCourse as a student to help keep my skills sharp. I really enjoy teaching the class room sections of the Basic RiderCourse.
