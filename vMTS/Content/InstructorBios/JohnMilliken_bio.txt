<p>I am 64 years old (man I hate that) and married to Jeannie for the last 38 years. I was with the Metro Police Dept. for thirty five and a half years. While there I worked in Patrol, Community Relations and Auto Theft Divisions and was assigned to Motorcycles in July 1974. I was still assigned to Motorcycles when I retired.

It was a fantastic life that I miss far more than I thought. It is the only job you get paid for doing the same thing you were doing when you were 18 years old, ridding around trying to get in trouble.They will even pay you to do it on a motorcycle.

I ride a  2004 Harley-Davidson Road King police commerative edition (what else). I love ridding and eating; do far to much of one and nowhere near enough of the other.

If MREP or I can be of assistance, send me an email.
